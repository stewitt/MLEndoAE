The provided code is a cleaned up and streamlined version of the code used in the paper "How machine learning on real-world clinical data improves adverse event recording for endoscopy" by Stefan Wittlinger, Isabella C. Wiest, Mahboubeh Jannesari Ladani, Jakob Nikolas Kather, Matthias P. Ebert, Fabian Siegel, and Sebastian Belle. Please note that the associated dataset contains sensitive patient information and cannot be shared publicly due to privacy regulations.

This project presents a machine learning-based approach to improve the detection of underreported adverse events in endoscopic procedures using real-world clinical metadata such as ICD codes and procedure timings. A random forest classifier trained on 2490 inpatient cases undergoing endoscopic mucosal resection was used to classify the adverse events of perforation, bleeding, and readmission. With our proposal, we aim to enhance patient safety and quality control by offering a privacy-preserving, semi-automated method to support more accurate documentation and clinical decision-making.
